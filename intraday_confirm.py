"""
Intraday confirmation layer for equities: VWAP position, Opening Range
Breakout (ORB), and relative volume, computed from today's 5-minute candles
via Angel One's historical candle API.

Used to gate buy_sell_alert.py's combined score+ML signal so it only fires
when today's actual intraday price action agrees with the direction, rather
than alerting purely on daily-bar fundamentals/trend data that may be stale
by the time the market opens.

Volume confirmation is liquidity-tiered, since a flat ratio means very
different things depending on how liquid a stock normally is:

  - Mega-cap (market cap >= 1,00,000 crore): needs today's volume >= 1.75x
    the 20-day average. These names are so liquid that even 1.75x is a real,
    unusual move.
  - Large-cap (market cap >= 20,000 crore): needs >= 1.5x the 20-day average.
  - Mid/small-cap (everything smaller): needs >= 2x the 20-day average --
    the highest bar of the three, since these stocks see noisier day-to-day
    volume swings and a smaller multiple wouldn't reliably separate a real
    move from ordinary noise.

Also checks a 3-day swing structure using daily bars:
  - Higher High + Higher Low (HH+HL) over the last 3 days (today's
    intraday high/low so far, vs. the prior two COMPLETE trading days)
    is an ADDITIONAL required condition for confirms_bullish -- on top of
    VWAP/ORB/volume, not instead of them.
  - Lower Low + Lower High (LL+LH) over the same window is exposed as
    swing_structure_bearish -- an INDEPENDENT protective-exit signal the
    caller can act on for any held position, regardless of what the
    score-based signal currently says.

Fails closed: if there isn't enough intraday data yet (e.g. right at market
open) or the candle fetch fails, get_intraday_confirmation() returns None
and the caller should treat that as "no confirmation" rather than guessing.
